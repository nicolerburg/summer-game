[NAME = King Bismuth]
I see you have managed to make it to me...
I hope the journey was not as treacherous as it is to some.
By now I bet your mind is filled with questions. Why did Meredith entrusted our secret to you?
The truth is that we are in danger...
As Meredith grows older, the spell that keeps our world seperate from the humans grows weaker.
When she is gone we will no longer be protected from the destruction that mankind brings.
She trusted you with this secret, so that you may venture forward and learn the power of the forest.
You must return to the human forest and begin your quest.
Return to the human forest and walk through the mist!
There are many trials to come, but, at the end, you will have the magic to protect us.
The magic to keep Woodville in balance.
Be safe and may I see you soon again!
