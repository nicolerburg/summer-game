Welcome to the real forest of Woodville. I'm sure Meredith has let you know a little bit about us, but you probably want to learn more!
Our king, Bismuth, is anxious to meet you and explain our troubles, but you'll have to journey to his court.
Our part of the forest has been contructed to fit our needs and abilities, so you may find it difficult to navigate.
Thankfully, you can switch between ours and the human world to find the best path through the forest!
Here...
See that ledge up ahead...
It is probably too high for you to jump, but you may have more luck in the human world.
Try it out!
