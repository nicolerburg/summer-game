[NAME = Maple]
I see you found our bridge...
It's true, the human world is often more trecherous than ours.
Up ahead we've used magic to create self moving elevators for our goods, but no matter what we've tried, we can't get them to come into sync in both worlds.
I'm afraid to get across you'll have to switch back and forth.
Good luck!
